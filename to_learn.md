+ Parts:
    1- Learning the shell
    2- Configuring and the envirement
    3- common tasks and essential tools
    4- writing shell scripts

+ bash: Burn Again Shell
+ command history remember last 500 command by default

    cd + pathname: pathname will be considred as root of the tree to the desired location
    example:
        /a/b/c/d
        a is parent of b  (b is child of a)
        b is parrent of c
        ...
